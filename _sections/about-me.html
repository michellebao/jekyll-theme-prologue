<p>I'm interested in understanding the development and impacts of sociotechnical 
    structures and institutions, while envisioning alternative approaches and incentives that 
    prioritize community care and creativity. I am a serial hobbyist (intermediate 
    ceramicist, amateur silversmith, neglectful kombucha parent), aspiring writer, and 
    occasional technologist. Things that I'm currently thinking about 
    include the beauty and perils of context collapse, bad fortunes,
    and whether this website will be ingested by an AI model.
     
    I'm a recent graduate of Stanford, where I received a B.S., Minor, and M.S. in 
    Symbolic Systems, Ethics and Technology, and Computer Science, respectively. </p>
