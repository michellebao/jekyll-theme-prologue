<p><br>I'm interested in understanding the impacts of sociotechnical 
    institutions, while envisioning alternative approaches that 
    prioritize community care and creativity. I am a researcher, occasional technologist, 
    serial hobbyist (intermediate ceramicist, amateur silversmith, neglectful kombucha parent), 
    and aspiring writer. Things that I'm currently thinking about 
    include the beauty and perils of context collapse, bad fortunes,
    and whether this website will be ingested by an AI model.

    I'm a recent graduate of Stanford, where I received a B.S., Minor, and M.S. in 
    Symbolic Systems, Ethics and Technology, and Computer Science, respectively. </p>
